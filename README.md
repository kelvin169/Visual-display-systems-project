# Visual-display-systems-project
So part of our school project entailed coming up with a utility system that actually searves a purpose. 
what we did was come up with a speech to text system that simply uses an esp8266 Node MCU along with an 8X8 LED matrix.

The second part of the projects works based on Adafruit and ability to add plugins to the code itself
